run variations of our algorithm on the gridworlds (forward, backward, adaptive
create graphics of the solved mazes 


Topics for presentation


#0 

#2 effects of ties between large and small g
	data to store; path lengths, total times A* is ran, number of times we expand nodes

#3 forward vs backward

#5 forward A* vs adaptive A*

#6 Memory issues



Can we cut down on runtime?

isInClosedList: checks every element of the closed list, can we create a hashtable instead?
	end of pg5 of assignment description
	never iterate over all cells except to initialize them













TO-DO before coming back to show allen

****Data driven script****
store data about each algorithms performance
	instead of printing to the screen write it to a file 

	
	
make it possible to make graphics want?
test on large mazes


****Demo driven script****
create pictures and show performance for a few mazes
every time we run the program print out the final path in graphics where the path, start, end, blocked and unblocked are seperate colors
details about the search I.e path lengths, total A*s performed, number of nodes expanded






We need to generate a report for: 
repeated forward A* (small g) 
repeated forward A* (large g)
backwards A*
adaptive A*


Writing to file formatting 
maze file name
A* executions
# of expanded cells
path length
solution (path)
